# Contextualization
Here where I work(Curitiba-Paran√°-Brazil) is a civil and electrical engineering office focused on projects of pulp industries, what we do is basically model(3d) electrical and structural designs according to technical standards commonly called NBR's ( in Portuguese), the NBR's requests us to have the specific value of occuped area of each gate (leito de cabos in Portuguese) these areas before I arrive here were calculated manually, so my first task here were automate this way of get the value of each gate.
